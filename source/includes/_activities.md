*Available modes of operation: real-time*

The Activities endpoint is used to track the life cycle of a transaction.  Results returned will follow the states through which an Activity flows in the PokitDok platform. Long-running operations are performed asynchronously. Upon initiating those operations via an API endpoint, activity tracking information is returned to the caller, which can be used to query the status of the activity later on.


### Endpoint Description

Available Activity Endpoints:

<!--- beginning of table -->

| Endpoint              | HTTP Method | Description                                                                                   |
|:----------------------|:------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| /activities/ | GET | List current activities. A query string parameter ‘parent_id’ may also be used with this API to get information about sub-activities that were initiated from a batch file upload. |
| /activities/{id} | GET | Return detailed information about the specified activity. API applications will receive an activity ID in the API response for all operations that are asynchronous. |
| /activities/{id} | PUT | Used for canceling activities that a client application no longer wishes to execute. This functionality cannot be used for activities after they have left a scheduled state and been transmitted to the trading partner. |

<!--- end of table -->

### Response

The `/activities/` response includes the following fields:

<!--- beginning of table -->

| Field | Type | Description |
|:----- |:---- |:-----------|
| callback_url | {string} | The URL that will be invoked to notify the client application that this Activity has completed. You must use https for callback URLs used by your application. For added security, a callback URL can be defined in the application. |
| callback_error | {string} | Displays the error information associated with a failed callback attempt. |
| created_date | {string} | The date/time that the activity was created on the platform. |
| history | {object array} | Historical status of the progress of this Activity. |

| history.name | {string} | State name associated with the history. |
| history.title | {string} | State title associated with the history. |
| id | {string} | ID of this Activity. |
| last_updated_date | {string} | The date/time that the activity was last updated by the platform. |

| trading_partner_id | {string} | Unique id for the intended trading partner, as specified by the [Trading Partners](#trading-partners) endpoint. |
| parent_id | {string} | Id only present on sub-activities that were initiated via a batch file upload of activities. |
| parameters | {dict} | The parameters that were originally supplied to the activity. |
| remaining_transitions | {array} | The list of remaining state transitions that the activity has yet to go through. |
| result | {dict} | The result of the activity processing.  This will be populated with the latest response from a trading partner. |
| result_history | {object array} | A list of result values that have been received from a trading partner.  This list will be present when a request results in more than one response from a trading partner.  The most recent response will always be available in the result field for convenience. |
| result_history.result | {dict} | The result associated with the result. |
| result_history.record_dt | {datetime} | The date time associated with the result. In ISO8601 format (YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.ssssss). |
| state | {dict} | Current state of this Activity. |
| transition_path | {array} | The list of state transitions that will be used for this Activity. |
| units_of_work | {int} | The number of 'units of work' that the activity is operating on. This will typically be 1 for real-time requests like /eligibility/. |
| tracking_description | {string} | A value that summarizes the tracking/outcome of long running transactions like claims.  It's currently only supported on claims activities.  Possible values can be found in the [Tracking Descriptions](#tracking-description) table |
| payment_id | {string} | A unique identifier used to reference payment details associated with the Platform Activity. This value is supported on claims activities where claim payments, or ERAs, are processed. The payment_id may be used to lookup payment details using the /payments API. |
